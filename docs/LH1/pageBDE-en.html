			<H2> Jules Michaud </H2>
			<p>
				What better way to experience the election campaign than to interview the different presidents? First of all, our dear president Jules Michaud, beloved by all telecom students, has agreed to answer some of our questions. Here is his poignant testimony.
			</p>

				<br /><h3><em>
					Not too sad?
				</em></h3>
				<p>
					It's always a bit difficult because when you give so much to a project, especially for a year, and you instill your values, your way of being and thinking, the project starts to become a part of you. I know that a part of me is going away, but on the other hand, I think I've done my time and that a new fresh wave of motivated people will be a good thing for the BDE, so that things will continue to evolve in the right way.
				</p>
				<br /><h3><em>
					What do you think of the newbies?
				</em></h3>
				<p>
					I'm REALLY happy to see how things are shaping up, the two lists are very different, in their way of thinking, organizing, and acting... However, both lists have a lot to bring to the BDE. I admit that I'm also very curious to know who will win because at the moment I really have no idea ahah.
				</p>
				<br /><H3><em>
					Campaign memories (good and bad)?
				</em></H3>
				<p>
					I have many good memories, it's hard to choose! What comes to mind is the "nuit des d√©fis": thanks to Margaux's sacrifice who spent the night managing the challenges distribution and export (thank you again ü•∫), I was able to go and do tons of challenges with my team in Palaiseau. What makes me laugh the most is when I think about the things we did that night, like jumping into bushes, counting grains of rice in a room with people doing meditation, construction tutorials, walking on the moon and going to space... and I imagine these things out of context. They make absolutely NO sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can't not mention the reveal party, during which I almost passed out at the announcement of the results: so much stress, energy, work, and adrenaline accumulated over four weeks, and everything just came crashing down, it's a lot! But what an incredible image when the Bedia logo appeared on the screen...
				</p>
				<p>
					In the end, I have very few bad memories of this campaign, I tend to focus on the good sides. Maybe I could mention the evening of the Breaking Bed party, where I spent the night vomiting (even though I hadn't drunk, but I'll keep the cause quiet so as not to do them harm), before going to prepare the breakfast. Don't worry for those to whom I delivered breakfast, I recovered in the meantime and was all clean to cook ‚ù§Ô∏è

				<br /><h3><em>
					Your favorite pasta dish?
				</em></h3>
				<p>
					Carbonara without any discussion, but aglio, olio e peperoncino pasta is way too underrated (cc Valerio)
				</p>
				<br /><h3><em>
					Your favorite color?
				</em></h3>
				<p>
					For something more neutral, grey, for something a bit more eccentric, pink.
				</p>
				<br /><h3><em>
					How much money have you diverted for the bureau?
				</em></h3>
				<p>
					Top secret information, sorry, I'll take the answer with me to my grave.

			<H2> Candidates </H2>
			<br>

			<p>
				In order to learn about the different lists, we also infiltrated the "binouze des d√©fis du bar" to interview the presidents. Beware, we will reveal juicy information about the different lists, which could be shocking!
			</p>

			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					What's your feeling about the campaign?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> R√©mi Breton (Flambed) </h4>
				<p>
					Well, it was a great campaign, but there was a lot of bitterness, we don't talk about it enough. There were a lot of bitter people, including myself, but other than that, it was great, I enjoyed it.
				</p>
				<h4> Ma√´l Le Guillouzic (Scarabed) </h4>
				<p>
					So far, the campaign is going really well, we are all very happy with the relationships with the other lists, with the bar, all the lists are giving their all, creating incredible events. Generally, it's quite challenging, with a lot of serious challenges to be met with very little sleep, but it's a really good experience together and it's nice!
				</p>
				<h4> Elo√Øse Casartelli (Discobed) </h4>
				<p>
					Well it's lots and lots of fun, for example, there are 22 of us with red hair right now, which makes me laugh a lot. It's really cool, there's stress but it's really good times, and often the "traquos" (traquenards, TBM) are the funniest things.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					Why vote for you?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> Elo√Øse C </h4>
				<p>
					It's for the values of our BDE. We want to unite the class, we want there to be love. Also, we didn't want to make the list with just our friends, but rather with people who would correspond to us, so that they represent each part of the class and so we don't forget anyone, which you will see in our events. And otherwise, it's fun, we want joy, we want smiles, so vote for us! That's what the class will be like next year!
				</p>
				<h4> R√©mi B </h4>
				<p>
					Why vote for us? Well, who did all this? I mean, the all-in-one apero was really something, that alone is an argument. Then there's the Super Maxi Mardi, even if the Maxi Mardi managers were against us, a big conspiracy, you know. And then there's the campaign video, the video is a good point.
				</p>
				<h4> Ma√´l LG </h4>
				<p>
					Personnally, I think you should vote for the list that animates Telecom the best. Everyone should vote for the list they believe in. Otherwise, why vote for us specifically? Honestly, we are a super united list, we are all highly involved in student life and it's something that is very important to all of us to value.
				</p>
				
			</div>
			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					First measure you will implement if elected?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> Ma√´l LG </h4>
				<p>
					First reform, in chronological order, at the WEI: we realized this year that a lot of work had been done last year to include international students, but the current BDE and the lists realized that there was still a lot to be done, and we really believe that this work should be done from day one. Of course, these aren't just empty words, there will be concrete actions, which we're working hard on to have the strongest possible impact. There will be measures at the WEI, in September, then in October and every other month, to try to break down this barrier between French and international students, to give international students who want to include themselves this opportunity, because it's up to the BDE to create this opportunity.
				</p>
				<h4> Elo√Øse C </h4>
				<p>
					My fight is everything related to REC and VSS, so I would like to get involved with the "charte du plateau", because there is a charter being built, and I really want to see where it is at and for Telecom to be part of this charter. Then, it's about completely changing the awareness-raising work because for me, it's not good enough. It's very good upstream, but when things happen, there aren't enough procedures. So, it's mainly on this aspect that I would focus my work personally. After that, it's up to the whole team. We are working on our campaign promises, I'll tell you all about it in a few days!
				</p>
				<h4> R√©mi B </h4>
				<p>
					Making sure the bar fucks the BDE (que le bar encule le BDE).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					Your favorite pasta dish?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> R√©mi B </h4>
				<p>
					Arrabiata sauce is incredible. I'm a man of taste, you know.
				</p>
				<h4> Elo√Øse C </h4>
				<p>
					Pesto pasta, I eat it all the time, it's what's best.
				</p>
				<h4> Ma√´l LG </h4>
				<p>
					Well, I'm allergic to pesto, and my favorite is carbonara pasta!
				</p>
				
			</div>
			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					Your favorite color?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> Ma√´l LG </h4>
				<p>
					Black, it's discreet, it matches with everything, and at least you don't make color mistakes.
				</p>
				<h4> R√©mi B </h4>
				<p>
					Pink, like Babar.
				</p>
				<h4> Elo√Øse C </h4>
				<p>
					I like all colors &lt;3
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<br /><h3><em>
					How much money have you diverted for the bureau?
				</em></h3><br />
				<h4> Elo√Øse C </h4>
				<p>
					Well, personally, a few thousand, but it doesn't benefit everyone. You just have to be in a high position for these kinds of things. But go see the treasury, they are very nice!
				</p>
				<h4> Ma√´l LG </h4>
				<p>
					Well, so much! So much that we can't do the campaign week anymore, we have no money left. But we are trying to hide it, so it would be nice if you didn't say anything about it, otherwise we're in trouble.
				</p>
				<h4> R√©mi B </h4>
				<p>
					Thousands of euros, thousands of euros! There's some negative balance problem with all of this. But all the lists are corrupt, there isn't one that isn't! But we will donate a lot of money to Telespoir, who will give it to the poor because they need to eat, the poor.
