                <H1> Chamonix, short but intense </H1>

				<p>
					We left at 6:30 PM, and according to the GPS, we will arrive at 12:16 AM. We just need to avoid delaying too much for the meal break.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					Rafting is an opportunity to awaken rivalries or simply let off steam by targeting random objects near our boat. We pretend to be pirates, attacking other boats, capturing hostages, repelling invaders, but wait! A 360-degree turn, and we're off again.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					Multiple power strips cascading infuriates TSM. Tristan rewires the electrical setup. A simple tarp alone prevents nature's wrath from pouring onto all the electronic devices of the Telecom students. It's a huge responsibility that it handles perfectly, or at least I hope so... The same can't be said for the tents, and mistakes happen. Beware if you don't close your mosquito net properly, Maël, or you'll have to sleep in your car...
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					At the campsite, people play pétanque, and they also read Kafka or Le Corbusier (Telo?). They sing under the tents, and we all have an apéro together. Devoted staff members prepare burgers, simple but delicious food that feels great after a long day of effort. 
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					The river water is so cold! It's time to jump. 2 meters, 4 meters, 7 meters for the bravest. Canyoning is a test of endurance. Probably not the most efficient way to cover a few hundred meters, but certainly the most intense.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					We got lucky; it was supposed to rain all weekend, but in the end, the clouds held back and only focused on the last evening. We salvage what we can, pack up what could be saved in the tent, and wait.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					We wake up timidly; it's time to tidy up the tents and belongings. We negotiate seating arrangements in the car. Some tents are still standing; not cool for Orci... The BDS collects all the forgotten items. They haven't slept much this weekend; tonight, it's a shower and off to bed!
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to the BDS for this invigorating weekend! A mandate ends beautifully.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					I love the mountains; they're beautiful and soothing. I already miss them. I want to go back; it was so short!
