                <p>First question from one of our readers:</p>
				<p><div style="font-size: larger;"><b>Question : </b></div>
                    Hello D., <br>
                    I'm in a relationship but madly in love with my boyfriend's best bro, what should I do? <br>
                    Margot T."
                </p>
                <p><div style="font-size: larger;"><b>Answer : </b></div>
                    Dear Margot.</p>
                <p>Firstly, I would like to thank you for your question. You have made the right choice in not following your own inner voice in this situation, and choosing to rely on a specialist, and not just any specialist.</p>
                <p>Your situation is far from unique, dear Margot. It only takes a few moments on Twitter to quickly find hundreds of anonymous help messages from users facing similar dilemmas, and shared by just as anonymous accounts that have made it their specialty and have met with great success. </p>
                <p>You are in love with someone else, that is a fact. Does that mean you no longer love your current partner? If that is the case, the answer seems self-evident, you should follow your heart. However, I will explore the opposite case, which raises far more questions. Because if you are writing to me, it is because the answer to this question is not obvious to you.</p>
                <p>If you feel this way, it is probably because you are not fulfilled. Ask yourself what is wrong in your relationship, what you prefer about the other person. Can you change it with your current partner? If you were to leave him, what would be better with the other person?</p>
                <p>But the question that must be burning on your lips, my dear, must be different.</p>
                <p><i>Is it ethical to leave with his best friend? </i></p>
                <p>I will invoke the great poet of philosophy that is Friedrich Nietzsche: </p>
                <p><b>« Believe me! The secret to harvesting the greatest fruitfulness, and the greatest enjoyment from life, is to live dangerously. »</b></p>
                <p>To be an adventurer of morality and ethics, to experiment with it to better discover it, to explore to know your limits, this is what this warrior of the spirit teaches us.</p>
                <p>A life spent as a slave to the judgment of others, in the forced adoption of their morality by instinct of social survival, will make you lose yourself in the eyes of others. </p>
                <p>These words should not lead you to consider leading a double life for the sake of adrenaline (I cannot be held responsible for your actions, it goes without saying), or to consider a free relationship. The final choice is yours. I urge you to open your mind to find yourself, consider all options and judge them according to yourself.</p>
                <p>In any case, talk to this friend first, so as not to risk finding yourself in the worst situation. See if he also accepts the potential loss of his friend. It goes without saying that your exploration of morality is suspended by the consent of those you impact. </p>
                <p>Whatever happens, never forget your cramptés.</p>
                <p>Dr. Strangelove.</p>
