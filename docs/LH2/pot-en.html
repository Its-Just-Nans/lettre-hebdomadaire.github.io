				<h1>POTentially democratic (potentially rigged)</h1>

				<p>There we are, the big day has arrived. After a month of trials, of teasing, of fun and of competition, we are finally about to discover who will be the new BDE.</p>
				<p>While TSM, always motivated, is preparing the evening, plugging in the sound system and fighting on rolling panels, ScaraBed and DiscoBed are painting the traditionnal drapery. Tonight, Flambed treats us : pizza break in the patio. The nights have been short and the lists are sleeping on foot or wandering in the foyer. We can feel the stress and the eagerness. Everyone agrees : they did not expect to sleep this little, and this week-end, it's gonna be a coma for them.</p>
				<p>It is now 22:00, the party itself has begun. It's cold outside, hot inside, and the room is buzzing with people, with pronostics, and, most of all, with anticipation. Bedia is dying, but who will be their successor ?</p>
				<p>After two hours of waiting, everyone is gathering in the foyer. Even the Ludo is empty. We climb on tables, on friends' shoulders, we push, we joke. We sing "transition supélec" to accompany the blue screen. We applaud when the film starts, we applaud when Jules appears, we scream to the tall people to get off the space in front of the screen but nobody hears anything because everyone is overexcited. The coin falls : FlamBed. Wait. No.</p>
				<p>ScaraBed du Nil.</p>
				<p>For some, it's the cold shower, for others, the triumph.</p>
				<p>The winning members are jubilating, they are eager to take office, to start working on their projects.</p>
				<p>The losers are fair play : they know that there will be few cooptations. They talk about the other associations that they are interested in, they are eager to see what the others will do.</p>
				<p>The future president of the BDE tell us about his evening. First of all, he repeats many times, with a wide smile, that it's really a great surprise since it's been so close. During the counting, at ALJT, the old BDE purposefully created a tie, to drag on the suspense. The final gap ? 24 votes, apparently.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The BED is dead, long live the BED.</p>
